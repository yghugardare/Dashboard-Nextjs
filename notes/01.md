## Benefits of next js

## what is pre-rendering

Pre-rendering is the process of generating HTML for each page in advance, rather than relying on client-side JavaScript to render the page. With pre-rendering, the fully formed HTML is sent to the browser, which can improve website performance and search engine optimization (SEO).

When the page is loaded, the JavaScript code runs and makes the page interactive, a process called hydration. Pre-rendering can be done through server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG).

## what is Static Side Generation

- Pages are pre-rendered at build time, generating static HTML files.
- The HTML pages are the same for all users and are reused on each request.
- Dynamic data can be fetched during the build process and injected into the static HTML.
- Provides fast page loads as the content is readily available.
- Ideal for websites with content that doesn't change frequently and doesn't require real-time updates.
- Excellent performance, caching, and search engine optimization (SEO) benefits.

## What is Server Side Rendring?

- Pages are rendered dynamically on the server for each user request.
- The server retrieves the necessary data and generates the HTML response.
- Allows for dynamic content that can be personalized for each user.
- Slower initial page load as the server needs to process the request.
- Suitable for applications with real-time data updates or personalized content.
- May require more server resources to handle the rendering on each request.

### SSG >> SSR
Next.js provides developers with the flexibility to choose between SSR and SSG based on their specific needs. They can opt for a hybrid approach as well, combining both SSR and SSG to create a dynamic yet performant application.

## What is CDN? How it works? Benefits?

![cdn](./images/cdn.png)

A CDN, or Content Delivery Network, is a network of distributed servers located in different geographical locations. The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver content, such as web pages, images, videos, and other media, to users more efficiently and reliably.

Here's how a CDN works:

1. Geographical Distribution: CDN servers are strategically placed in various locations worldwide, often at exchange points between different networks. This ensures that the content is closer to the end users, reducing the latency and improving the overall performance.

2. Caching and Edge Servers: When a user requests content, the CDN determines the closest server (called an edge server) to that user and delivers the cached copy of the content from that server. If the content is not available in the cache, the edge server retrieves it from the origin server and caches it for future requests.

3. Load Balancing: A CDN automatically optimizes the distribution of incoming requests across its network of servers. It distributes the load, directing the user requests to the most suitable server based on factors like proximity, server load, network conditions, and performance.

4. Content Optimization: CDNs often include additional features to optimize content delivery. These can include file compression, image optimization, minification of code, and other techniques that help reduce file sizes and improve load times.

Benefits of using a CDN:

1. Faster Content Delivery: The distributed server network allows content to be served from servers closer to the end user, reducing latency and improving page load times.

2. Improved Scalability: CDNs can handle large volumes of traffic by distributing it across multiple servers, reducing the load on the origin server and improving overall scalability.

3. Load Balancing: The load balancing feature of CDNs ensures that requests are efficiently distributed, preventing any single server from being overwhelmed and ensuring a smoother user experience.

4. Better User Experience: Faster content delivery and improved performance lead to a more seamless and responsive user experience, reducing bounce rates and increasing user engagement.

5. Enhanced Reliability: CDNs offer redundancy and failover mechanisms, preventing single points of failure. If one server fails, the request can be automatically routed to another available server, ensuring high availability of content.

6. Cost Savings: By offloading the delivery of content to a CDN, organizations can reduce their bandwidth costs and infrastructure requirements, as much of the content is served from the CDN's network of servers.

Overall, CDNs play a crucial role in optimizing content delivery, improving performance, and providing a better user experience for websites and applications.
